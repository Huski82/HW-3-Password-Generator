# HW-3-Password-Generator

The homework assignment for UC Berkeley coding Bootcamp was to deploy a functioning application that emphasizes the use of Javascript to generate a random, secure password for the user.
My project is deployable to GitHub & the project is up and running.
I also have a link to my project demonstration.
